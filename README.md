# Picollo

Cross-jurisdictional demonstration of Legislation as Code.  Work in Progress.

The git repo contains a reactjs application that can be configured to talk to Open Fisca instances. It presents questions for a user to answer. These are used to run a simulation on openfisca to calculate pension eligibility in multiple countries. For the demonstration, we are using Israel, Uruguay, and Aotearoa.
Work is tracked as github issues, but managed using [Waffle.io](https://waffle.io/ServiceInnovationLab/piccolo)
